        <h1>Exceptional Consignments</h1>
        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Rail <b>Exceptional Transports</b> represent the rail industry in a nutshell. Under certain circumstances, a loaded wagon or any type of a rolling stock may become an <b>Exceptional Consignment</b> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term37">EC</MadCap:glossaryTerm>). In order to deal competently with customers ordering exceptional consignments and efficiently declare transports parameters to the infrastructure managers, one needs to be familiar with the numerous aspects of rail transport.</p>
        <h2>Your Knowledge</h2>
        <p>As a standalone professional or a member of exceptional transport team you are expected to hold broad knowledge and thorough understanding of rail.</p>
        <p>You need to understand: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the restrictions imposed by rail infrastructure</li>
            <li>rolling stock types and their key parameters importance for exceptional transports</li>
            <li>the wide range of goods and the transport conditions they must meet while moved by rail</li>
            <li>operational difficulties which exceptional consignments may cause</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The User Guide</h2>
        <p><b>Railway Undertaking</b> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term6">RU</MadCap:glossaryTerm>)&#160;intending to move an exceptional consignment, applies to the <b>Infrastructure Manager</b> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term7">IM)</MadCap:glossaryTerm> for a transport authorisation. The format of the transport authorisation request uses the UIC template with 38 codes which are adopted by the vast majority of RUs and IMs.</p>
        <p>This guide is meant to be your handy source of information required for competent authorisation requests handling. It is meant to be mainly available online via computer, notepad or a mobile phone. Vast majority of information is provided through online (HTML5) output. In addition, for specific use-cases in the application see also a pdf. file, which you will find in the Handy chapter.</p>
        <h2>The User Guide's Navigation </h2>
        <p>The user guide is split into two main parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Quick frontal access</b> to an overview of the exceptional transport authorisations requests and the three groups of data. There you will find the specific application codes with examples of standard  declarations.</li>
            <li><b>Upper /side menu access</b> to the chapters. These chapters provide you with the normative background context of UIC&#160;exceptional consignments. The normative background is supported with examples of dedicated declarations for specific use-case examples.</li>
