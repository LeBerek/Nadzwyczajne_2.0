        <h1>Outline Procedure</h1>
        <p>Outline procedure serves as a subcategory for consignments that encroach the gauge. It serves for  out-of-gauge consignments which do not have the characteristics of any other type of the exceptional consignments. Two UIC documents: Rules for the procedure are set in the UIC 502-2 Leaflet and IRS 50502-1.</p>
        <p>When IM applies an outline procedure on their network, it is RU’s responsibility to carry out the initial inspection of the transport. RU runs the check for the transport against:</p>
        <p>•	the criteria set out in the respective UIC document,</p>
        <p>•	the criteria specific to respective Infrastructure in order to differentiate the consignment from exceptional consignment procedure</p>
        <p>•	provisions of IMs Network Statement</p>
        <p>When RU runs the examination of the consignment that encroaches the loading gauge it is the RU's responsibility to check the availability of an outline profile in the IM’s profile catalogue for the transport criteria.</p>
        <p>If there is no profile in the IM’s profile catalogue, an application for  exceptional consignment approval must be submitted to IM.</p>
        <p>Establishing the permissible outlines of structure gauges for oversized consignments with the largest possible dimensions requires also the constituent values like safety envelopes and other, at IM's discretion, which will ensure the safe operation of trains with oversized consignments.</p>
        <p> Explaining thoroughly the rules and the profiles numbering for this subsystem is well beyond the scope of this project. However the basic principle is here explained. </p>
        <p>Image – example profile.</p>
        <p>Currently the Outline Procedure is fully introduced and biding in Austria by ÖBB Infra. ÖBB Infra currently applies rules of UIC Leaflet 502-2, and is also ready to switch to new Outline Procedure rules set out in the IRS 50502-1. </p>
        <p>Railway undertakings running trains in Austria are obliged to apply ÖBB Profiles when consignment meets criteria laid out in respective ÖBB Profile, without need to especially contact Infrastructure Manager. An oversize consignment in the ÖBB Profile is declared for operation while ordering the schedule and by indicating the exact ÖBB Profile Number.</p>
        <p>In Austria also Combined Transport trains run in ÖBB Profiles in accordance with the outline procedure for structure gauge. At ÖBB, the Combined Transport route profiles are summarised in 3 groups:</p>
        <p>•	ÖBB profile 170: valid up to P/C 45 or P/C 365</p>
        <p>•	ÖBB profile 171: valid from P/C 46 to P/C 50 or P/C 366 to P/C 380</p>
        <p>•	ÖBB profile 172: valid from P/C 51 to P/C 80 or P/C 381 to P/C 410</p>
        <p>Note: Some other infrastructure managers in Europe have  introduced path profiles for out-of-gauge loads, but their rules are biding internally on their networks. Therefore currently for RUs&#160;it is not possible to declare a train in a IM's  outline  profile. </p>
        <p>Information: Due to huge amount of data which needs to be extracted, elaborated and transformed into an examined profile data It takes years to codify the entire IM's railway network. </p>
