        <h1>Vehicle Gauge</h1>
        <p>Vehicle gauge is one of the technical characteristics of a railway vehicle and concerns the permitted size of a vehicle. More precisely the vehicle gauge is a set of rules encompassing a reference profile and its associated calculation rules which  determine the vehicle’s maximum exterior dimensions and the required clearance area within the infrastructure to prevent the contact of the vehicle with the structure gauge.</p>
        <p>Information: Rolling stock constructors apply one of the three calculation methods. Vehicle's conformity with a reference profile is declared based on calculation method referred as static, kinematic or dynamic one. The calculation methods within a single reference profile for example G1 are independent. That is, depending on the calculation method used, the vehicle design will make more or less use of the railway lines room capacity provided by the infrastructure manager. </p>
        <p>The static method is the oldest calculation method and the most conservative. At the same time, it is the simplest one to apply. Also the method which RUs apply for evaluation of consignments dimensions so to decide whether they constitute the exceptional consignment is based on this method.</p>
        <p>Since 2009, the wagons have been marked with the kinematic gauge reference profiles to which they were built. Since 2014 the gauge marking has been updated and additionally includes a separate marking of the lower and upper vehicle gauges.</p>
        <p>Vehicle gauges are indicated by letters: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>G with the numeral 1 or 2 for regular rolling stock gauges - example: G1</li>
            <li>G with the letter A, B or C for newer widened in the upper part gauges - example: GC</li>
            <li>G with additional letter I and with the numeral 1, 2 or 3 for the lower than 400 mm from the rail head part of the vehicle - example: GI2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only the vehicle G1/GI1 is truly international vehicle gauge (except for Great Britain). Other vehicle gauges might require additional checks.</p>
        <p>Before operating authorised vehicles, the RU should conduct a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term4">route compatibility check</MadCap:glossaryTerm> in line with its Safety Management System <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term19">SMS</MadCap:glossaryTerm> . Vehicle's gauge examination is part of this thorough check and it is fairly easy part of the full process of the route compatibility check. See two examples of gauge check:</p>

        <p>Then, since IMs shall make available to market participants, in open access, information on the vehicles' reference profile gauges  that are compatible with their network, you may find information on the permitted vehicle reference profile gauges in the:</p>

        <p>Note: Interoperable, Multinational and National gauges currently are not populated with data. These parameters are left for informational reasons only.</p>
        <p>For wagon For Vehicles wagon or vehicle markings G1, G2 refer to the kinematic gauges as specified in TSIs. </p>
        <p>Warning:&#160;Some IMs like for example in Poland require that all vehicles introduced by an RU&#160;on their network do conform with the static vehicle gauge profiles. In such case just comparing the ERATV data and RINF data may be insufficient to decide if a vehicle built to kinematic gauge conforms actually with the static gauge provisions and are compatible with the static vehicle gauge profile. In such a case the only way to examine a vehicle's size is to run an inspection of a detailed vehicle's drawing or a study with calculations of vehicle's restriction analysis. The later type of document is rarely made available to RUs.</p>
