        <h1>Remarks to the Critical Points</h1>
        <p>Point #19 of the application form is dedicated to remarks on critical points describing load or vehicle. It is also used for loads which have no critical points and for which it is necessary to explicitly sate that the loading gauge is not exceeded as it informs infrastructure managers that dimensions of a load or of a vehicle where checked by RU. The following summary contains the most commonly used declarations to be made in the application. Of course, other declarations relating to cargo dimensions or  load class may also be included here. These declarations may be added individually or as a group of declarations - the number of declaration used depends on the type of the load or a vehicle and also on the type of communication.</p>
        <h3>No fouling of the loading gauge</h3>
        <p>For loads on wagons declare the specified loading gauge profile conformity when you leave empty values in critical points from #12 to #15. </p>
        <p>Example: Not fouling the loading gauge UIC LG Table 1.4 when loaded on wagon series Xxxx. </p>
        <p>For vehicles including wagons declare conformity with specified Vehicle Gauge Profile. </p>
        <p>Example: Does not exceed the vehicle gauge profile G1 in accordance with UIC&#160;505-1 or EN 15273-2 (respectively).</p>
        <h3>Dimensions of payload</h3>
        <p>This declaration serves well when critical points are left empty. <br />For regular cubic loads these dimensions can be also useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> transhipment when nett height values of the load are not separately stated in the point #13b</li>
            <li>a group of loading units like containers their type and size codes are insufficient to identify the width of the container, or group includes various widths of acceptable containers. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Connect critical points with a straight line or curve</h3>
        <p>Description of the critical points shown on the front view of load on the wagon or a vehicle shall allow RU and IM to allow to replicate the full contour of the load to be reconstructed beyond the gauge. Such description of critical points is also necessary to analyse the dimensions of the consignment when loading takes place on wagons with various loading heights of the loading levels.</p>

        <h3>A loading tolerance of... mm is taken into account in the half width (12a/12b)</h3>
        <p>Each IM has  different rules regarding the declaration of cargo dimensions, whether only net or with tolerances. In addition, in the UIC Loading Guidelines, certain groups of goods have specific loading tolerances for particular groups of goods. It is a good practice to inform if critical points contain also loading tolerance. The value of tolerance may be for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>null - Loading tolerance is not included</li>
            <li>lateral - 15 mm of centring tolerance is included</li>
            <li>upwards - 50 mm tolerance is included for uplift</li>
            <li>downwards - wagon sinking tolerance of 25 mm is included.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Centre of gravity</h3>
        <p>It is presumed that majority of loads while loaded on the wagon then their overall centre of gravity is located centrally on the line of intersection of the longitudinal and transverse plane of symmetry of the wagon. In such a case the declaration of the centre of gravity location is usually not additionally required. It might be required if shape of the load is complicated or the consignment consist of a number of smaller units then it is useful to state if the centre of gravity is located centrally on a wagon. When the overall location of the centre of gravity of the load is shifted in relation to the longitudinal and transverse symmetrical planes of the wagon, then location of centre of gravity must clearly declared. It shall be declared either by means of a code with dimensions or in a descriptive way. </p>

        <h3>Peculiarities of payload (load securing)</h3>
        <p>In general all loads shall be transported as secured in accordance with rules set in UIC Loading Guidelines. For loads which are loaded according to the principles of coloured information sheets (pink, blue and yellow) it may be necessary to declare the information sheet number in the application form.</p>
        <p>For the loads for which there are no equivalent methods of alternative securing arrangements to already mentioned methods it may be necessary to declare the information sheet number in the application form to infrastructure manager. For sure "load securing measures to be taken must be agreed between the RUs involved" - UIC LG.</p>
        <p>Examples of declarations for load securing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Loading of rails in accordance with UIC Loading Guideline Annex II, Volume 2,  Loading guideline 1.8.3</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Exceptional consignment due to flexible loading unit with a length of more than  more than 36 metres.</p>
            </li>
