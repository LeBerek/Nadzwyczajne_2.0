        <h1>Exceptional Consignment - Definition </h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the ERA&#160;Report on Facilitation of combined transport from year 2018 it was noted that: "there is currently no clear definition of what an exceptional transport is. In addition, what is considered as exceptional transport in one Member State might be not exceptional in another. COTIF is mentioning exceptional transport but not at the level of details that allows to have a harmonized situation. <br />It is necessary to distinguish two situations: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a train path ordered for exceptional transport and a train path ordered with special conditions (..)</li>
            <li>one-off and recurrent exceptional transport."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Years passed and the concept of an exceptional consignments still isn't harmonized. <br />Exceptional transport as well as specific requirements to operate combined transport trains exceeding the loading gauge but not exceeding the codification of the line are still open points in the EU Regulation (EU)2023/1693 amending Implementing Regulation EU 2019/773 on Technical specification for interoperability relating to the operation and traffic management subsystem of the rail system within the European Union.</p>
        <h2>Definition of Exceptional Consignment for the Project</h2>
        <h3>TSI&#160;OPE Working Party (2018)</h3>
        <p>In the above mentioned report,  there is a definition proposal which serves well for the purpose of this project.</p>
        <p>Exceptional consignment is: “A vehicle and / or the load carried which because of construction / design, dimensions or weight does not meet the parameters of the route and requires special authority for the movement and may require special conditions over part or its entire journey”.</p>
        <h2>National Rules</h2>
        <p>(to be updated, H3 General + H3 Poland)</p>
        <h2>International Rules (1435 mm)</h2>
        <p>UIC&#160;IRS 50502 (2021) in short:</p>
        <p>Definition of exceptional consignments: An exceptional consignment gives rise to particular technical and / or operationg conditions in railway facilities or vehicles for at least one of the parties involved in the carriage of the consignment due to to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>its dimensions ,</li>
            <li>its weight or </li>
            <li>its properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions must be agreed in advance between all RUs and /or IMs involved"</p>
        <p>This definition has in addition three sub-definitions: 1. 1 Out of gauge loads,1.2. Heavy Load , 1.3 Other exceptional consigments. These sub-definitions are reflected in the top menu of the project.</p>
        <h3>CIM SMGS Consignment Note Manual (2022)</h3>
        <p>Within the area in  which  the CIM applies, the definition below, based on UIC leaflet 502-1, applies: a consignment is considered as exceptional, if, because of its external dimensions, its mass or its nature, it gives rise to special difficulties for one of the carriers taking part in the movement taking account of railway installations and wagons and therefore can only be authorised under special technical or operating conditions."</p>
