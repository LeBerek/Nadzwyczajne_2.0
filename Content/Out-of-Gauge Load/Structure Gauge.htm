        <h1>Structure Gauge</h1>
        <p>Static Method</p>
        <p>For consignments exceeds the gauge, the possibility of its transport should be checked, taking into account, among other things: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>load distribution on the wagon, </li>
            <li>critical points of the consignment (wagon and/or load), </li>
            <li>lateral deviations of the longitudinal axis of the wagon </li>
            <li>individual critical points of the consignment from the track axis in curves, </li>
            <li>operational deviations resulting from the interaction of track and rolling stock. The basic radius of the curve is taken as R = 250 m.</li>
        </ul>
