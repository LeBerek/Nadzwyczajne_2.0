        <h1>Rigid Load Units</h1>
        <p>In exceptional transports goods are usually considered while loaded on individual wagons. Goods longer than the maximum loading length of the wagon, and beyond the wagon length can also be transported by rail, when some restrictions are observed. Restrictions for long goods exceeding wagon loading length vary depending on the flexibility of the load.</p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p><b>Rigid long goods</b> are transported as  <b>exceptional consignment</b> when they are loaded on special <b>wagons with pivoted bolster</b> or <b>rotary sliding bolster</b>, and if necessary also with barrier/intermediate wagons.</p>
        <h2>Consignment Data</h2>

        <h2>Load Overhang</h2>
        <p>Rigid goods which overhang over the coupling zone may swing out further than the wagon body when the wagon runs on the curved tracks. This is why it is necessary to reduce the width of the load overhang in order to take load's tilt out into account while examining consignment’s conformity with the requested path. </p>
        <p>You deal with normal rigid long consignment when it :</p>
        <p>[image/ graph/ add]</p>
        <ul>
            <li>is loaded on one wagon</li>
            <li>protrudes over the maximum loading length </li>
            <li>protrudes over the coupling zone, </li>
            <li>it's overhang measured longitudinally from the bogie pivot axis till the front or end edge the load does not exceed the length of 10 m</li>
            <li>is transported with protection wagon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition in such a case always examine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> that the load width restrictions which are set in UIC Loading Guidelines Tables are observed, </li>
            <li>the larger value of the overhang, when the load overhangs on both ends of the wagon.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>axle load values especially when centre of the load gravity is if the centre of gravity is displaced along the wagon in relation to the central intersection of the three axes of symmetry of the wagon under consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Above checks are necessary to conduct since of these loads due to their length and width dimensions and because of shifted centre of gravity may become as reasons for exceptional consignments with out of gauge or as heavy transports. </p>
