        <h1>Lack of Interoperability</h1>
        <p>European Vehicles running on their own wheels when they do not have the required interoperability in country forming part of the route or approval/authorisation to place in service become exceptional consignments. For such vehicles   each application submitted for exceptional consignment  should contain a note on missing vehicle's authorisation in concerned countries.</p>
        <h2>Missing authorisation</h2>
        <p> applies equally to vehicles which are empty, loaded or which  themselves are the subject of a contract of carriage and when they are not registered as authorised (placed to service) in concerned country, or which do not have the inscriptions or respective marks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>passenger coaches</b>
            </li>
            <li>RIC </li>
            <li><b>freight wagons</b>,</li>
            <li>TEN GE </li>
            <li>RIV</li>
            <li>acceptance marking: TEN&#160;+ G1 or concerned country acronym in approval plate</li>
            <li><b>traction units and multiple units</b>
            </li>
            <li>concerned country acronym in approval plate</li>
            <li><b>special vehicles</b>
            </li>
            <li>concerned country acronym in approval plate or IM's/EVU s code in bi- or multi- lateral agreement grid</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>EVN Number</h2>
        <p>In <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term8">EU</MadCap:glossaryTerm> railway vehicles are registered in European Vehicle Register (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term9">EVR</MadCap:glossaryTerm>). <br />Registered vehicles have 12-digit <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term2">EVN</MadCap:glossaryTerm> number which holds information on technical characteristic of the vehicle. Checking the first digit of the EVN number in combination with country where the vehicle is registered allows you to  decide if you are dealing with an authorised or a missing authorisation vehicle.</p>

        <p>Detailed specifications on EVN vehicle number assignment are laid out in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018D1614">Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1614</a> </p>
        <h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
        <p>In the absence of vehicle's authorisation, the transport of vehicles on their own wheels requires supplementary technical and operational details. This information, necessary for the application to IM, can be sourced from the vehicle’s documentation or, to some extent, from its markings. Compiled data should be incorporated into the authorisation application by the dispatching RU or added as an appendix.</p>
        <p>NOTE For vehicles towed on their own wheels without own power fewer declarations are required in addition to the application. For vehicles running with their own power IMs requires more detailed declarations on compliance with the planned route. </p>
        <h2>Vehicles without authorisation to place in service /approval.</h2>
        <p>Two tools can be attempted to retrieve vehicle information: for vehicles - ERTATV and for routes - RINF. If no information is available for the vehicle in question, ask the client for providing them. State corresponding declarations  in the application, under items #28 on vehicle properties and #29 on vehicle operating properties.</p>
        <p>For initial check you need to examine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>member state of authorisation</li>
            <li>current authorisation status</li>
            <li>certificate for the ability to run</li>
            <li>vehicle's gauge - reference profile</li>
            <li> continuous brake pipe availability and efficiency</li>
            <li>type of traction (optional)</li>
            <li>buffing and coupling gear</li>
            <li>distance between two adjacent axles not exceeding 17 500 mm</li>
            <li>distance between the last axle and the buffers</li>
            <li>smallest negotiable track radius<br /></li>
            <li>minimum in
service wheel  
diameter</li>
            <li>the ability to be hump shunted</li>
            <li>position where to put into the train (any, the last or as the rear of the train)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional questions and declarations may become necessary depending on the type of vehicle and on the operational compatibility of the vehicle.</p>
        <p>New vehicles in testing phase may already have a 12-digit EVN assigned. Ask the customer about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>EVN numbers of the vehicle. If not yet available, then about the manufacturers vehicle numbers so in  code #2a you can declare vehicle numbers individually or as a list of vehicle group</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> the status of the EVN number, as it may have status "reserved". If you deal with a freight wagon with the first digit 2 or 3, then be cautious while assessing wagon's authorisation for the network. Inform IM respectively in code #2b</li>
