        <h1>Flexible Load Units</h1>
        <p>In exceptional transports goods are usually considered while loaded on individual wagons. Goods longer than the maximum loading length of the wagon, and beyond the wagon length spread on several wagons can also be transported by rail, when some restrictions are observed. Restrictions for long goods exceeding wagon loading length vary depending on the flexibility of the load.</p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p><b>Flexible load units</b> which are <b>loaded on more than two wagons</b> are transported as exceptional consignments.<br /></p>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Flexible units like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  rails longer than 36 m, </li>
            <li>steel rods for concrete, </li>
            <li>plastic pipes and etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>when loaded on sets of several wagons with collapsible end boards or stanchions they are to be transported as exceptional consignments. On networks of: BDZ, EWS, FS, HZ, MZ, ZFBH, ZRS, ZS, ÖBB, PKP, ADIF, ASTOC, SNCB, SNCF, SZ and TCDD, load units loaded on more than two wagons are considered exceptional consignments, even when they are forwarded in block trains.</p>
        <p>On certain railways <MadCap:xref href="Other National Rules.htm" target="_popup" title="Find out where it is normal transport" alt="Link to alternative provisions description">Other National Rules</MadCap:xref> apply for such transports in line with UIC&#160;Loading Guidelines provisions.</p>
        <h2>Long Rails </h2>
        <p>Steel is more flexible than one may think at a first glance.  The longer the rails are the longer wagon sets are needed to transport them. For example for rails long 120 m it may take from 6 to 9 wagons to compose a wagon set. Rails are transported in layers on the flat wagon sets. Rail layers are supported by fixing blocks and supportive frames. Fixing long rails  in supportive frames, neither too loosely nor to firmly, allows rails to simultaneously shift on curves to accommodate to small curves such as with radius of  150 m. </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the case of the flexible goods which cover the coupling zone longitudinal play must be taken into account. The transport units must be coupled in such a way that the buffers are in slight contact. This is important in order to maintain an even load on the wheel sets of the individual wagons throughout the set. If there are significant variations in the height of buffers, it could lead to the infrastructure manager’s (IM) rolling stock detection and monitoring systems registering false axle overload conditions. This might be detected in certain wagons that are carrying long, flexible loads within the set. It is virtually impossible to correct rail's loading method while on wagon set during transport, and therefore such situations should  be actively avoided.</p>
