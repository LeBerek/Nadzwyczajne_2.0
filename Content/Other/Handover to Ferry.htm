        <h1>Handover to Ferry </h1>
        <p>Most goods shipped by rail to ports are routed to harbour loading quays or port terminals, depending on their type and transfer method  to the ship.  In Europe, some trains are run to ports in rail-ferry communication. In the both cases of exceptional consignment trains to a port, it is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ascertain to which specific tracks in the port area the train with the exceptional consignment is to be directed,</li>
            <li>inquire whether  exceptional consignment approval is also granted by the port infrastructure managers for this type of consignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Consignments which are to be transshipped to a ferry, when they do not meet the regulations of General Contract of Use of wagons (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term33">GCU</MadCap:glossaryTerm>), Appendix 14, Part A constitute the other type of exceptional consignment. </p>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Rail-ferry  transfer locations and specific rules are listed in Part A of GCU&#160;Annex 14. Each  port and ferry has individual characteristic of  access for a train and therefore some restrictions apply which wagon must fulfil to be accepted on a ferry. Observe wagon marking:</p>
