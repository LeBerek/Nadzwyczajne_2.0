        <h1>Goods Data</h1>
        <p>The check of goods data  provided by the consignee is crucial to ensure the safe and efficient movement of cargo. When goods are transported as exceptional consignment the declaration in these three points is mandatory for all types of transported commodities .</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#1a<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Type of goods and NHM code*</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Declare the type of the transported goods and add the NHM&#160;harmonized commodity code.<br />For example:  Containers HC&#160;ISO Type 1, NHM: 9931, 9941 (empty and loaded).</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#8<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Weight of payload* [t]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Enter the actual dead weight of the cargo. Check whether the weight declaration should include the securing of the load. In the absence of an exact dead-weight value, state the maximum payload limit for the desired line class of the path.<br />For example: 87, 45 (including 2 tons of load securing devices), max. load limit for class C3.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#11<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Length of payload* [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Indicate the total length of the cargo. For multiple cargo units on the wagon indicate length of each unit. Maximum loading length declare only for cargo units which do not exceed this length and  the required distance from fixed wagon parts is maintained.<br />For example: 11000, 12400 (2x 6200), max. available loading length.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>Declaration of the dimensions of the consignment’s critical points  takes place in the application's points 12-15. Critical points declaration is mandatory for all cargo units which while loaded on the wagon, and after applying narrowing reductions,  they foul the loading gauge. Declaration of these points may be also required for the wagons which are oversized. While describing critical points keep in mind that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a capital letter in alphabetical order is assigned for each next cargo contour point which is declared, </li>
            <li>their parameters declared in points 12-15 (plus optional 16-18)  should be presented in the form of a table,</li>
            <li>they should be declared for the smallest loading gauge on the entire planned route. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> These dimensions are always declared by the consignee. but they are used in the application form only for the oversized cargo. The two parameters below describe the consignment's dimensions while viewing cargo unit on the wagon in the frontal projection.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#12<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Half-width of the payload [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Declare cargo widths separately for the left-half in (12a) and for the right-half in 12(b). <br />For example:(a/b) 1620 / 1620 (symmetrical),  (a/b) 1450 / 520 (asymmetrical), (a/b) 952/ 0 (asymmetrical)</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>

        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#13<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Height above top of rail [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The height of the wagon with cargo declare as a fixed value or as a height range for dedicated cargo width.  <br />For example: 3250, 1155-3200.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>These two points describe consignment's dimensions while viewing wagon with cargo unit from the side projection.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#14<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Longitudinal distance n<sub>i</sub> [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Describe lengthwise how far towards the center of the wagon, the critical point of the cargo unit is located i from the end axle of wagon not fitted with bogies or from the bogie center. The value in this point cannot be higher than a half of the distance value which describes the distance  between end axles of vehicles not fitted with bogies or between bogie centers.<br />For example: 6500, 7200.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#15<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Longitudinal distance n<sub>a</sub> [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Describe lengthwise how far towards the end of the wagon, the critical point of the cargo unit is located i from the end axle of wagon not fitted with bogies or from the bogie center. The value in majority of cases does not exceed the distance value from the end axles of wagons not fitted with bogies or bogie centers to the end of maximum loading length. Observe that some cargo units are loaded just between the end axles or bogie centers (then declare 0 for his parameter).<br />For example: 0, 1900, 2250, 3015.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>Remarks on the cargo unit dimensions are always declared. These remarks may contain information related to the critical points or state that the cargo unit does not exceed the loading gauge. </p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#19<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Remarks on the critical points</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For critical points declaration will describe the way the critical points can be connected to create a contour. In addition it may provide information on the included value of the loading tolerance, and on location of the center of gravity. For cargo units which are not oversized but have other properties of an exceptional consignment, the declaration states that it is not oversized.<br />For example: Points A with B and C connect with straight line. Consignment does not exceed the loading gauge.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>Declaration of the points 16-18 may be required by an Infrastructure manager in national permit applications for the goods which while placed on the wagon foul the loading gauge. In applications for international transports these three points are not mandatory since each infrastructure manager has their own rules how to calculate oversized exceptional consignments.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#16<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Dynamical supplement [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The value of the supplement for deviations in the horizontal plane  is set by an infrastructure manager. These values are published either as a table or calculated from the formula for set height. The value increases with height of the calculated critical point.<br />For example: 102 (value set by PKP&#160;PLK S.A. for the height from 3801 till 3900 mm).</p>

        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#17<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Allowance for curves [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The values of allowance for curves are declared for (a) the curves with radius R = 250 m and (b) with radius R = ∞, where ∞ is defined as radius &gt; 1000 m. The tables with values are published by infrastructure managers or can be calculated with formulas. The allowance for the curves is checked separately for the for inner and for the outer point. The largest allowance value of the distance  between the end axles of vehicles not fitted with bogies or between the bogie centers, or outside of them, is to be declared for the infrastructure manager.<br />For example: (a/b) 185 (153 + 32) / 51 (43+8 ) (values set by PKP&#160;PLK S.A. for the wagon with bogie centers distance of 14200 mm)</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The value of the needed space is calculated as a sum of values declared in the points 16 and 17, and is presented separately for the (a) the curves with radius R = 250 m and (b) with radius R = ∞, where ∞ is defined as radius &gt; 1000 m. <br />For example: (a/b) 287 / 153 (calculation based on values binding for PKP&#160;PLK S.A infrastructure manager.</p>
