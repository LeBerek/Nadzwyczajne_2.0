        <h1>Out-of-Gauge Load</h1>
        <p>When wagon with goods exceeds the predefined dimensions of height and width of the loading gauge or a vehicle on own wheels exceeds the predefined vehicle's  profile, then railway undertaking sdeal with the gauge foul. A wagon with load or a vehicle is considered as exceeding the gauge if:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>its contour due to its width or height, when positioned on a straight and level track, does not fall within the applicable gauge contour at least on the one section of the transport route under consideration,</li>
            <li>on the straight and level track contour falls within the gauge, but after application of the loading width restrictions from UIC&#160;Loading Guidelines, Volume 1 and Tables 2<sub>1</sub>, 2<sub>3</sub> and 2<sub>5</sub> have not been complied with.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> In such a case the transport of such a wagon and cargo set or a vehicle on own wheels might be still possible on the carriage conditions for an exceptional transport, on the route indicated and proved by an infrastructure manager.</p>
        <p>Railway undertaking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>determines the smallest loading gauge on the entire route from the departure station to the destination station,</li>
            <li>identifies critical points of the consignment,</li>
            <li>suggest the preferred route</li>
            <li>chooses approval method for the consignment</li>
            <li>files an application form to the infrastructure manager for exceptional consignment.</li>
            <li>or alternatively runs the consignment with combined transport conditions or with outline procedure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Infrastructure manager approves the conditions with restrictions to run the consignmet and sends them to the railway undertaking.</p>
        <p> In the extreme cases infrastructure manager might issue a refusal for the transport of the oversized consignment. In such a case the reason for issuing a refusal must be clearly declared by the infrastructure manager.</p>
        <p>but it requires a permit for exceptional consignment which fouls the gauge. To apply for such permit find here guidance on the topic.</p>
