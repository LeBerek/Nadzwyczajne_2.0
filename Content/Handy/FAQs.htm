                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Is the container length code sufficient to determine the out-of-gauge encroachment?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Not really. Out of gauge size is determined based on the combination of a container width and height from the top of rail while on a wagon. Therefore for the loading gauge compatibility check always declare dimensions of the set consisting of the container on the wagon. Or else, your request to apply for the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term37">EC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> permit will be returned to you with a request to update the missing parameters.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot> Is it sufficient to declare the container as <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term38">HC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> without indicating the wagon type?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Not really. High Cube describes the container's height 9,5 feet (2896 mm). It does not refer to the actual width of a container. When one container is loaded  on wagons with different geometrical characteristic and loading pain heights it will manifest fixed width but with various heights in the loading gauge profile. In addition HC container may have various widths. Therefore it is crucial to declare both the container's height and the width and all wagon types intended for the transport.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For ISO&#160;Type 1 containers with  2438 mm it is enough to declare 4-character code of type and size of the loading unit. For wider containers in addition to the type and size code declaration in addition maximum width declaration is required. For <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term10">CT</MadCap:glossaryTerm> Trains  ina ddition information on yellow codification plate with C profile with profile's number is required.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For a cuboid with constant width and height it is sufficient to mark just the maximum dimensions. For cuboid shapes of which the upper part is narrowed for the gauge compliance, it is necessary in addition to declare exact dimensions of the tapered corners.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How to declare the interoperability marks on wagons?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The declaration of RIV or RIC signs without additional descriptions is sufficient. When declaring TEN signs, specify if the wagons also have GE or CW signs. In the case of CW wagons  ask in addition for the wagon gauge marking. For wagons with a derogation plate or an authorisation plates ask for content of these plates in order to determine compatibility with the rail networks to which you are directing the wagon.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How to declare multiple loading units on various series of wagons?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In one application form it is possible to declare more than one type of a consignment on one type of wagon. You enter required parameters of all wagons intended for the transport and name the consignment type. If consignments are out of the gauge  you create multiple tables with dimensions of the load and wagon in addition. Some IMs accept that the RU creates a common outline for all loads on all types of wagons in a train. Developing a train outline requires experience. If you are not sure how to do it and do not know anyone who can help you, do not create an outline. Declare dimensions individually.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot> Is it sufficient to indicate the DIUM station code to specify the destination station.</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>It helps to declare the DIUM station code in the application, but it the case of larger stations this might be challenging to decide to which siding or terminal or quay the consignment is destined. In such a case specify the exact area at larger station where the wagon with consignment is destined.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This situation might be challenging for your commercial colleagues who do freight calculations. In such case always contact them and make sure which station instead as a commercial destination is preferred. Advice other participating RUs accordingly on the situation.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>When can I use the notation "to various destination stations"?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you’re sending a consignment that will only take one specific route on your manager’s network, but it will go to various stations on another network, it’s useful to declare it as “to various destination stations”. Also, list these stations under point #22. If you’re unsure of the other stations, but presume the consignment have potential to be sent to other foreign stations, you can also label it as “to various stations” without additional stations list. In this case, keep a separate record of any additional destination stations you add. Just make sure that your infrastructure manager allows this solution.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Do I always have to specify a preferred route?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In general it is good idea to declare preferred route. Keep in mind that block trains might have different routes than regular trains. Declaring the preferred route assures that train drivers have the route knowledge. Preferred route for wagon groups must include the routing through marshalling stations. Note that in the case of very large consignments, it is better not to specify the preferred route in the application, because in such a case the infrastructure manager decides the way that the train can run on.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How do I apply for two border crossings in one application?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you apply to another RU abroad using an entire network  permit then in one application in point #23 you list all commercially agreed border crossings in one application. Note that on some IM's networks this possibility is limited to different border crossings within one regional area (eg. DB&#160;InfraGO).</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>What if the shipment is exceptional only in the country of shipment?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In such a case you need to apply for a IM's permit only in the country of origin. You do not need to inform the other participating RUs before hand over takes place. Keep in mind that in case of a return path, more RUs will be involved in EC application process, despite that it is exceptional just in one IMs network.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Our recommendation: add a fictive estimated time of departure. State the date two or three weeks in advance, so the IM can plan his work load capacity accordingly.</p>
